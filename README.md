# 🏃‍♀️ Ultra-Marathon Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Title
**Two Centuries of Ultra-Marathon Analysis: A Deep Dive into 50KM & 50MI Races in the USA**

---

## 📂 Project Description

This data analysis project explores a rich dataset of ultra-marathon races spanning over 200 years. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, trends, and insights specifically from 50KM and 50MI races held in the **United States in 2020**. 

The goal was to clean and filter the data, derive meaningful insights about athlete demographics and race events, and visualize key performance metrics using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation
- **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Matplotlib** – Plotting charts

---

## 📊 Main Objectives

- Load and explore the ultra-marathon dataset.
- Clean and preprocess inconsistent fields such as:
  - Race distances (e.g., 50KM and 50MI)
  - Athlete performance time format
  - Country extraction from event names
- Filter races held in the **USA in 2020**.
- Derive and analyze **athlete ages** from their birth years.
- Visualize age distributions and race participation.

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- 📌 Distribution of USA-based 50KM & 50MI races
- 📌 Histogram of athlete age categories
- 📌 Athlete performance time cleaning and formatting
- 📌 Event name breakdown and country filtering

---

## 🔍 Insights

- Most ultra-marathons in the USA during 2020 fell under the 50KM or 50MI category.
- Performance times were standardized for better comparison.
- Age distribution insights helped understand the participation of different age groups.
- Cleaning textual data (e.g., event name and athlete performance) was a critical step.
